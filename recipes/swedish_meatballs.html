    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
        wedish meatballs are one of the easiest, most delicious ways to switch up your weeknight meatball routine.
        Unlike their Italian counterpart, Swedish meatballs are warmly spiced (think: nutmeg and allspice) and simmered
        in a creamy gravy, perfect for ladling over mashed potatoes or egg noodles.
    </p>
    <p>
        These meatballs are too good to only be enjoyed inside the IKEA food court. Here’s how you can make an even
        better version any night of the week.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>12 ounces lean ground beef</li>
        <li>12 ounces ground pork</li>
        <li>3/4 cup panko breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>1/4 cup whole or 2% milk</li>
        <li>1 Large egg</li>
        <li>1 large shallot, grated</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <h3>EQUIPMENT</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Measuring cups and spoons</li>
        <li>Chef's knife </li>
        <li>Cutting board</li>
        <li>Large skillet</li>
        <li>Large mixing bowl</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Make the meatball mixture. Place all the ingredients in a large bowl and use your hands to gently work
            everything together into a homogenous mixture.
        </li>
        <li>
            Shape the meatballs. Scoop the meatballs into 2 tablespoons portions — about the size of a ping-pong ball —
            and use the palms of your hands to press and roll into smooth balls. Set aside on a baking sheet.

        </li>
        <li>Brown the meatballs. Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil and 1 tablespoon of the butter in a 12-inch high-sided
            sauté pan over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add half of the meatballs and cook, turning them every 1
            to 2 minutes, until browned on all 4 sides, about 8 minutes total. Transfer the meatballs to a plate and
            repeat with the remaining oil, butter, and meatballs.</li>
        <li>Make the gravy. Sprinkle the flour over the remaining fat in the pan and use a wooden spoon to scrape up the
            browned bits. Cook the flour until it no longer appears dry, about 1 minute. Add the beef broth and whisk
            until smooth and just beginning to simmer.</li>
        <li>Cook the meatballs in the gravy, uncovered, for 10 minutes. Return the meatballs to the pan along with any
            juices from the plate, snuggling them in close together. Simmer in the gravy, uncovered, until the meatballs
            are cooked through and the gravy has thickened, about 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Add the half-and-half to the gravy and serve. Remove the pan from the heat. Add the half-and-half and gently
            shaking the pan to combine. Tatse the gravy and season with salt and pepper as needed. Serve the meatballs
            and gravy over cooked egg noodles or mashed potatoes and sprinkled with parsley if desired.</li>
    </ol>
