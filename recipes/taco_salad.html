        honestly, is there a better salad than taco salad? Crisp romaine gets
        punched up with cilantro and onions, then tossed with crunchy tortilla
        strips, spicy ground beef, shredded cheese, and lots of fresh veggies like
        corn and tomatoes. It’s the perfect combination of flavors and textures.

        <li>Crunchy Tortillas</li>
        <li>Spicy Beef</li>
        <li>Fresh and Easy Toppings</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <h3>EQUIPMENT</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Measuring cups and spoons</li>
        <li>Chef's knife </li>
        <li>Cutting board</li>
        <li>Large skillet</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Fry the tortilla strips. Heat the oil in a large skillet over
            medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the tortilla strips and fry,
            stirring occasionally, until golden-brown and crisp, 2 to 3 minutes.
            Remove the tortilla strips to a paper towel and sprinkle with salt.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook the taco beef. Drain off any excess oil from the skillet and return
            it to medium-high heat. Add the beef and cook, breaking the meat up into
            small pieces with a stiff spatula, until cooked through and starting to
            brown, about 8 minutes. Add the salsa and taco seasoning and cook until
            the liquid in the pan thickens slightly, 2 to 3 minutes more. Remove the
            skillet from the heat while you build the rest of the salad.
        </li>
        <li>Make the dressing. Whisk all the ingredients together in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>Build the salad. Place the romaine, cilantro, and scallions or onion in a large bowl and toss to combine.
            Add the corn, black beans, tomatoes, cheese, and avocado if using. Top the salad with the browned beef and
            tortilla strips</li>
        <li>Dress the salad and serve. Just before serving, add half of the dressing to the salad and use tongs to toss
            until well coated. Taste and add more dressing, if desired.
        </li>
